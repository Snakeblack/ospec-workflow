# SDD Phase — Common Protocol

Boilerplate identical across all SDD phase skills. Sub-agents MUST load this alongside their phase-specific SKILL.md.

Executor boundary: every SDD phase agent is an EXECUTOR, not an orchestrator. Do the phase work yourself. Do NOT launch sub-agents, do NOT call `delegate`/`task`, and do NOT bounce work back unless the phase skill explicitly says to stop and report a blocker.

## A. Skill Loading

1. Check if the orchestrator injected a `## Project Standards (auto-resolved)` block in your launch prompt. If yes, follow those rules — they are pre-digested compact rules from the skill registry. **Do NOT read any SKILL.md files.**
2. If no Project Standards block was provided, check for `SKILL: Load` instructions. If present, load those exact skill files.
3. If neither was provided, read `.atl/skill-registry.md` from the project root if it exists. From the registry's **Compact Rules** section, apply rules whose triggers match your current task.
4. If no registry exists, proceed with your phase skill only.

NOTE: the preferred path is (1) — compact rules pre-injected by the orchestrator. Paths (2) and (3) are fallbacks for backwards compatibility. If `## Project Standards` is present, IGNORE any `SKILL: Load` instructions — they are redundant.

## B. Artifact Retrieval (OpenSpec Mode)

If `artifact_store.mode` is `openspec`, read the phase-specific dependencies from `openspec/` before producing output.

Typical paths:
- `openspec/config.yaml`
- `openspec/specs/**/spec.md`
- `openspec/changes/{change-name}/proposal.md`
- `openspec/changes/{change-name}/specs/**/spec.md`
- `openspec/changes/{change-name}/design.md`
- `openspec/changes/{change-name}/tasks.md`
- `openspec/changes/{change-name}/apply-progress.md`
- `openspec/changes/{change-name}/verify-report.md`

If `artifact_store.mode` is `none`, use only the context passed by the orchestrator and return the artifact inline.

## C. Artifact Persistence

Every phase that produces an artifact MUST persist it when mode is `openspec`. Skipping this BREAKS the pipeline — downstream phases will not find your output.

### OpenSpec mode

Write the phase artifact to the path defined by the phase skill and `openspec-convention.md`. If the file already exists, read it first and update it instead of blindly overwriting.

### None mode

Return result inline only. Do not write project files.

## D. Return Envelope

Every phase MUST return a structured envelope to the orchestrator:

- `status`: `success`, `partial`, or `blocked`
- `executive_summary`: 1-3 sentence summary of what was done
- `detailed_report`: (optional) full phase output, or omit if already inline
- `artifacts`: list of artifact paths written, or `inline` for `none`
- `next_recommended`: the next SDD phase to run, or "none"
- `risks`: risks discovered, or "None"
- `skill_resolution`: how skills were loaded — `injected` (received Project Standards from orchestrator), `fallback-registry` (self-loaded from `.atl/skill-registry.md`), `fallback-path` (loaded via SKILL: Load path), or `none` (no skills loaded)

Example:

```markdown
**Status**: success
**Summary**: Proposal created for `{change-name}`. Defined scope, approach, and rollback plan.
**Artifacts**: `openspec/changes/{change-name}/proposal.md` | inline (none)
**Next**: sdd-spec or sdd-design
**Risks**: None
**Skill Resolution**: injected — 3 skills (react-19, typescript, tailwind-4)
(other values: `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none — no registry found`)
```

## E. Review Workload Guard

SDD must protect reviewer cognitive load, not only generate tasks.

- The default PR review budget is **400 changed lines** (`additions + deletions`).
- The orchestrator MUST cache a delivery strategy at session start: `ask-on-risk` (default), `auto-chain`, `single-pr`, or `exception-ok`.
- The orchestrator MUST pass `delivery_strategy` to `sdd-tasks` and the resolved decision to `sdd-apply`.
- `sdd-tasks` MUST forecast whether the planned work may exceed that budget.
- The forecast MUST include exact plain-text guard lines: `Decision needed before apply: Yes|No`, `Chained PRs recommended: Yes|No`, and `400-line budget risk: Low|Medium|High`.
- If the forecast is high, `sdd-tasks` MUST recommend chained or stacked PRs using deliverable work units.
- `sdd-apply` MUST NOT start oversized work unless the delivery strategy resolves to chained/stacked PR slices or explicitly accepted `size:exception`.
- Each chained PR slice must have a clear start, clear finish, autonomous scope, verification, and reasonable rollback.
- In a Feature Branch Chain, PR #1 targets the feature/tracker branch and later child PRs target the immediate previous PR branch; if GitHub shows previous slices in a child diff, retarget/rebase until the diff is clean.

This guard exists to reduce reviewer burnout and keep implementation delivery safe. Do not treat it as optional process noise.
